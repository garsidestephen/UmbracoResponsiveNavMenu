# UmbracoResponsiveNavMenu
A free Umbraco Responsive Nav Menu.

It uses Font Awesome for the burger and drop down icons so you will need to include a ref in your page to:-
https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.4.1/css/all.css

In your page Razor include:-
@Html.Partial("~/Views/Partials/Components/Nav.cshtml")

Also add to your pages a ref to the css and js files.  I have also included the SCSS files and es5 js if required.
